% NAME: PointsDetectionTracking
% 
% To estimate correspondences between the 2D matrices "base" and
% "unregistered". "base" and "unregistered" must be matrices of the same
% dimension. Two different types of features can be extracted. If
% "flag_Harris" is 1 the Harris points are extracted, otherwise the
% Shi-Tomasi corner points. In particular, "numberCorners" points are
% extracted from "base" and tracked in "unregistered". If
% "flag_PhaseCorrelation" is 1 the Phase Correlation algorithm is use to
% estimate a guess shift between "base" and "unregistered". If
% "PCscaleFactor" is a positive integer number greater than 1, the Phase
% Correlation is computed using a rescaled version of "base" and
% "unregistered". "PointsBase" and "PointsTracked" are the x-y coordinates
% (x-y means the column-row coordinate inside the 2D matrix) of the points
% extracted in "base" and tracked in "unregistered", respectively.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%  base             Input image used to extract the corner points. We
%                   suggest to cast to double and convert to mono-channel
%                   image.
%  unregistered     Input image used to track the corner points extracted
%                   from "base". We suggest to cast to double and convert 
%                   to mono-channel image.
%  numberCorners    maximum number of corners extracted from "base". We   
%                   suggest 150. 
%  flag_Harris      1 to extract Harris corner points. 0 to extract
%                   Shy-tomasi corner points. We suggest 0.
%  flag_PhaseCorrelation    1 to use the Phase Correlation algorithm to 
%                   compute an initial guess for the tracking of the
%                   corners.
%  flag_PCglobalORlocal  It can assume values 0 or 1. 0 means that the 
%                   metric used to determine the best shift inside the 
%                   Phase Correlation ALgorithm is the global RMSE 
%                   performed on the entire overlapping regions. 1 means 
%                   that the used metric is the RMSE performed using only 
%                   the pixels with highest value. 
%  PCscaleFactor    The value must be a positive integer. If greater than 1
%                   the input images are rescaled before computing the 
%                   Phase Correlation.
%
% OUTPUT:
%  PointsBase       2-columns vector of n x-y coordinates (x-y means the
%                   column-row coordinate): 
%                   Vector_nx2 = [xp1, yp1; ...; xpn, ypn].
%  PointsTracked    2-columns vector of n x-y coordinates (x-y means the
%                   column-row coordinate): 
%                   Vector_nx2 = [xp1, yp1; ...; xpn, ypn].
